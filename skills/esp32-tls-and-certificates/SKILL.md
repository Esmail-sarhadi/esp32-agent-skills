# TLS on ESP32

A TLS handshake is the most memory-hungry thing a small ESP32 does. It needs
about 40 kB of heap for a 2048-bit RSA handshake (more for 4096-bit), and it
needs the clock to be roughly right.

## Memory first

`mbedtls_ssl_handshake` returning `-0x7F00` (ALLOC_FAILED) is not a certificate
problem. Before the handshake:

- Free heap should be at least 50 kB, and the largest free block matters more
  than the total.
- Do not hold a large String of the response body while connecting.
- One TLS connection at a time on a classic ESP32. Two concurrent handshakes
  usually fail.

`CONFIG_MBEDTLS_DYNAMIC_BUFFER` and the `MBEDTLS_SSL_IN_CONTENT_LEN` /
`OUT_CONTENT_LEN` settings trade throughput for memory; 4 kB in and 4 kB out is
enough for most API calls.

## Certificates

Three approaches, in increasing order of maintenance:

1. **Skip verification** (`client.setInsecure()`): works, and is a decision to
   accept any certificate, including an attacker's. Acceptable for a lab.
2. **Pin one CA**: small, and breaks the day the CA rotates its intermediate -
   which happens more often than people expect.
3. **Cert bundle** (`esp_crt_bundle_attach`): the roots of the major CAs,
   ~64 kB of flash, no RAM cost, and it survives rotation. This is the right
   default for a product.

A server whose chain includes an intermediate that is not sent will fail
verification on the ESP32 even though browsers hide it by fetching the
intermediate. Test with `openssl s_client -showcerts`.

## The clock, again

Certificate validity is a date range. At boot the ESP32 clock starts at 1970, so
every certificate is "not yet valid" and the handshake fails with
`MBEDTLS_ERR_X509_CERT_VERIFY_FAILED`. Either start SNTP and wait for a
plausible time before the first HTTPS request, or accept the risk of skipping
time validation - but know which one you did.

## SNI

Servers hosting many domains (Cloudflare, most CDNs) need the hostname in the
handshake. Arduino's `WiFiClientSecure` sets it when you call `connect(host,
port)`. A raw `IPAddress` connect does not, and the server returns the wrong
certificate - which looks like a verification failure on a valid site.

## TLS versions

ESP-IDF 5.x supports TLS 1.3, but it is not the default on every Arduino core.
A server that requires 1.3 (some do now) will fail with a protocol error on an
older core. Check `MBEDTLS_VERSION_STRING` before blaming the certificate.

| Symptom | Usually |
|---|---|
| `-0x7F00` during handshake | not enough heap, or two connections at once |
| certificate verify failed | wrong CA, missing intermediate, or clock at 1970 |
| works at home, fails at the customer | captive portal intercepting, or a proxy |
| handshake takes 8 seconds | RSA 4096, or a slow link - use ECDSA where possible |
| fails only after deep sleep | clock reset, time never re-synced |
